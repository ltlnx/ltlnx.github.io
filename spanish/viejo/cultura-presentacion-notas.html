<p>畢卡索美術館 介紹簡報上的東西 位於西班牙南部的Malaga historia The
idea was first mooted in 1953 by Pablo Picasso and Juan Temboury
Álvarez, then Málaga’s Provincial Delegate of Fine Arts. The painter
wanted his work to have a place in Málaga, the city of his birth, but
the plan soon fell apart. Christine Ruiz-Picasso, widow of the artist’s
eldest son, Paul Ruiz-Picasso, came into contact with Málaga’s municipal
authorities in connection with the exhibitions Picasso clásico and
Picasso, primera mirada, held at the Episcopal Palace of Málaga in 1992
and 1994, respectively. The people of Málaga were so enthusiastic about
this first chance to see Picasso’s work in Andalusia that, in 1996,
Christine decided to resume her father-in-law’s 1953 plan.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Regional Government of Andalusia purchased Bellavista
Palace to house the museum, and Christine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso (the
artist’s grandson) donated 233 works to Fundación Museo Picasso Málaga
Legado Paul, Christine y Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, a foundation set up
specifically to establish and manage the museum.</p>
<p>Thus, fifty years year, the Museo Picasso Málaga finally became a
reality and was inaugurated by Their Majesties King Juan Carlos I and
Queen Sofía on 27 October 2003.</p>
<p>The donation made by Christine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso comprises the
core of the permanent collection of works by Pablo Picasso, which are
periodically complemented by selected pieces from the Fundación Almine y
Bernard Ruiz-Picasso (FABA) and other occasional loans. colecciones
Permanent collection works 233 Works on loan 162</p>
<p>The collection of the Museo Picasso Málaga provides an insight into
eight decades of Pablo Picasso’s work. Through the many different
approaches it offers, visitors can discover the thoroughness and huge
creativity of an artist who was an indispensable figure in the history
of modern art. As the exhibitions stemming from the collection show,
Picasso’s main strength lies in his versatility and enthusiasm: these
attributes, together with his bold experimentation by varying styles and
alternating materials, are what spurred him to carry out intense
artistic investigation throughout his lifetime. His constant urge to
explore the expressive possibilities of any medium, be it painting,
sculpture, printmaking or ceramics, among others, enabled him to give
shape to his pursuit through a variety of themes that are closely linked
to his environment and appear cyclically in his work.</p>
<p>The core of the collection is made up of 233 works by Pablo Picasso
gifted by Christine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, the artist’s
daughter-in-law and grandson, which are complemented from time to time
by a selection of works from the funds of the Fundación Almine y Bernard
Ruiz-Picasso and other occasional loans.</p>
<p>The Museo Picasso Málaga and its collection are a response to Pablo
Picasso’s wish for his work to be displayed in the city where he was
born on 25 October 1881. It was established on the joint initiative of
Christine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, whose gift marked the start of the
Museum’s collection, and the Junta de Andalucía, which devised the
project for a major museum that opened in the Palacio de Buenavista in
2003.</p>
<p>Since then, the MPM has been working on telling stories based on the
collection through exhibitions, publications and cultural and
educational activities, with the aim of exploring in depth the extremely
rich oeuvre of an artist of the modern movement who remains linked to
the present. The mission of the MPM is to ensure its impact on society
and in the future.</p>

<p>History and Architecture</p>
<p>The building that today houses the Museo Nacional del Prado was
designed by architect Juan de Villanueva in 1785. It was constructed to
house the Natural History Cabinet, by orders of King Charles III.
However, the building’s final purpose - as the new Royal Museum of
Paintings and Sculptures - was the decision of the monarch’s grandson,
King Ferdinand VII, encouraged by his wife Queen Maria Isabel de
Braganza. The Royal Museum, soon quickly renamed the National Museum of
Paintings and Sculptures and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado,
opened to the public for the first time in November 1819.</p>

However, the building’s final purpose - as the new Royal Museum of

King Ferdinand VII, encouraged by his wife Queen Maria Isabel de
Braganza.The Royal Museum, soon quickly renamed the National Museum of
Paintings and Sculptures and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado,
opened to the public for the first time in November 1819. The Museum’s
first catalogue, published in 1819, included 311 paintings, although at
that time its collection comprised just over 1,510 pictures from the
various Reales Sitios (Royal Residences). The exceptionally important
royal collection, which represents the foundation of the Museum’s
collection as we know it today, started to increase significantly in the
16th century during the time of Charles V and continued to thrive under
the succeeding Habsburg and Bourbon Monarchs. We owe to them the
presence of some of the Museum´s greatest masterpieces, such as The
Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch, The Nobleman with his hand on his
Chest by El Greco, Death of the Virgin by Mantegna, The Holy Family
known as The Pearl by Raphael, Emperor Carlos V on Horseback by Titian,
The Foot Washing by Tintoretto, Self-portrait by Dürer , Las Meninas by
Velázquez, The Three Graces by Rubens, and The Family of Carlos IV by
Goya. Puerta Velázquez</p>
<p>Villanueva Building, Velázquez entrance, (Paseo del Prado’s
façade)</p>
<p>In addition, more outstanding paintings - which belonged to the Museo
de la Trinidad - entered the Prado, among them The Fountain of Grace by
the School of Jan Van Eyck, Saint Dominic Presides over an Auto de Fe by
Pedro Berruguete, and five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio
de Doña María de Aragón. Most of the Museum’s 19th-century paintings
came from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the
Madrazo, Vicente López, Carlos de Haes, Rosales and Sorolla.</p>
<p>More than 2,300 paintings have been incorporated into the Museum del
Prado since its opening as well as a large number of sculptures, prints,
drawings and works of art through bequests, donations and purchases,
which account for most of the New Acquisitions. Particularly important
was the Barón Emile d’Erlanger’s donation of Goya’s Black Paintings in
1881. Among the works that have entered the collection through purchase
are some outstanding ones acquired in recent years including two works
by El Greco, Fable and The Flight to Egypt acquired in 1993 and 2001,
The Countess of Chinchón by Goya bought in 2000, and Velázquez’s
Portrait of the man called ‘The Pope’s Barber’ acquired in 2003.</p>
<p>Important bequests have enriched the Museum’s collection. Among them
we should mention the magnificent collection of medals bequeathed by Don
Pablo Bosch’s, the vast collection of drawings and decorative arts that
belonged to don Pedro Fernández Durán’s, and the Ramón de Errazu Bequest
of 19th-century Painting.</p>
<p>The Prado’s Collection as well as its number of visitors increased
greatly throughout the 19th and 20th century. In order to more fully
accommodate them, the Villanueva building underwent several expansions
to the point that any further intervention was no longer possible. At
this point, the Museum’s development was solved by constructing a new
building located on a site facing the east facade of the Prado, and
interconnecting the two buildings from within. Edificio Villanueva</p>
<p>Extension of the Museo del Prado by architect Rafael Moneo.</p>
<p>Coinciding in time with the execution of its latest and most
ambitious expansion plan (2001-2007), the Museum’s latest efforts
towards modernization took place in 2004 when changes of its legal and
statutory framework were approved. These modifications were based on the
need of providing the Museum with a more flexible management, speeding
up its performance and increasing its capacity to self-finance. The
Museum’s new status was made effective by the Museo Nacional del Prado
Act, November 2003, and a subsequent amending Statute approved by Royal
Decree, 12th March 2004.</p>
<p>(article) The Prado is Spain’s powerhouse museum. It opened in 1819
as the Royal Museum of Paintings. The vaunted museum celebrates its
200th birthday this year.</p>
<p>The museum was the brainchild of Ferdinand VII. He opened the museum
with approximately 300 paintings from the Golden Age of Spanish painting
in the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
<p>Today, the Prado has expanded to become one of the most sensuous and
extensive depositories of Western art in the world.</p>
<p>The artistic anchors of the Prado are Francisco Goya, Diego
Velázquez, and Peter Paul Rubens. But there are also masterpieces by
Titian, Bosch, France Angelico, and El Greco. You can wander endlessly,
in awe, through room after room full of beautiful paintings.</p>
<p>I’ve written previously about the highlights of the Prado and tips
and tricks for visiting, so won’t repeat myself here. Here’s my guide to
the Prado.</p>
<p>But be sure to see the Hieronymus Bosch’ The Garden of Earthly
Delights triptych, the Black Paintings of Francisco Goya (The Dog is my
favorite), Diego Velasquez’s Las Meninas, the newly restored Fra
Angelico Annunciation, and José de Ribera’s intriguing The Bearded
Woman.</p>

<p>The Museum of Fine Arts, Museo de Bellas Artes, Bilbao</p>
<p>Often overshadowed by the famous Guggenheim Museum, the Museo de
Bellas Artes is nonetheless one of Spain’s best museums.</p>
<p>If you’re an art lover, you should definitely head here. If you don’t
love modern art, skip the Guggenheim and come here.</p>
<p>Located in the Abando neighborhood, the museum boasts over 10,000 art
works, arranged chronologically from the 12th century to the
present.</p>
<p>It has works by Spanish artists Picasso, Goya, El Greco, Zurbaran,
and Chillada, as well as many international artists.</p>
<p>In 2018, the museum received a historic donation of a 1983 sculpture
from Richard Serra, Bilbao. In July 2019, it chose an architectural team
to oversee the enlargement of the museum, including restoring the
museum’s original entrance.</p>

<p>The Dalì Theater and Museum, Figueres</p>
<p>When one thinks of Salvador Dalì, his extravagant persona and iconic
waxed mustache immediately leap to mind. Dalì was a self-proclaimed
dandy, a showoffy megalomaniac who loved nothing more than creating a
sensation. And embracing money and fame.</p>
<p>One of the best day trips from Barcelona is a visit to the Dalì
Theater and Museum, or Teatro-Museo Dalí, in Dalì’s birthplace of
Figueres Spain. The pink museum is billed as the world’s largest
Surrealist object. It’s a work of art itself.</p>
<p>With over 1500 pieces of art, the Dalì Theater and Museum has the
largest collection of works by the trailblazing Salvador Dalí, with
pieces spanning his entire career. It’s nothing if not fun and weird,
with its double images and optical illusions.</p>
<p>Built between 1961-74, Dalì helped design the eccentric museum
himself. He said “I want my museum to be a single block, a labyrinth, a
great surrealist object.</p>
<p>It will be a totally theatrical museum. The people who come to see it
will leave with the sensation of having had a theatrical dream.”</p>
<p>Don’t miss the Palace of Winds Room (a whimsical reimagining of the
Sistine Chapel), the Mae West Room, Dalì’s clever double image of Gala
Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea, the Treasure Room, and the Dalì’
jewelry collection.</p>
