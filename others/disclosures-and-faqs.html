<h1 id="disclosures-and-faq">Disclosures and FAQ</h1>
<p>This page is created due to a desperate need to document some stuff I
implemented on the site. At first I crammed them in the <a
href="about.html">about</a> page, but found out that the details are
getting too long and boring, that it deserves a separate page. So here
they are.</p>

<p><strong>The Blogging System</strong><br />
Blogging is part of the fun, and creating and modifying a reading
experience is another. I’ve tried out <a
href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a
href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, and they are honestly pretty great and
flexible. But since I simply had to have more control over the styling,
I eventually retracted to writing my own pages in HTML. The current goal
is to write some shell scripts to prevent myself from writing raw HTML
again. (If you haven’t written pure HTML with CSS, do give it a try.
It’s fun and horrible at the same time.)</p>
<p>Currently my update script (or a horrible code noodle, depending on
your viewpoint) does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the content with <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a></li>
<li>Add outer HTML (headers and footers)</li>
<li>Create meta (as in “post list”) pages like the <a
href="../blerbs/index.html">Blerbs</a> page</li>
</ul>
<p>As an addition, I utilize other bash scripts to create an RSS feed
and the sitemap. They are all modified scripts from others but I
retained the copyright notice in the scripts. They can be viewed in the
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ltlnx/pages-src">pages-src</a>
repository.</p>
<p><strong>Why Codeberg?</strong><br />
This one boils down to personal preference. I had put my pages on <a
href="https://github.com">Github</a>, but did not feel comfortable with
it anymore (megacorp stuff). In reality anywhere outside of megacorps
would be fine, but I chose Codeberg because of its similarities to the
Github Pages workflow. In a parallel world I’d probably choose <a
href="https://srht.site/">Sourcehut Pages</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I’ve set up a backup site on Github: <a
href="https://blog2.ltlnx.tw" class="uri">https://blog2.ltlnx.tw</a>
(points to <a href="https://ltlnx.github.io"
class="uri">https://ltlnx.github.io</a>). Github Pages still has its
merits, like not enforcing TLS 1.2, so that I can view my page on older
browsers (e.g. on systems that do not have further updates, such as the
iPad 2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Typography and Fonts</strong><br />
The <a href="https://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html">web-safe
font</a> chosen is DejaVu Sans and Verdana for headlines, and Noto Sans,
Segoe UI and Lucida Grande for text. Serif and monospaced fonts are set
to <code>serif</code> and <code>monospace</code>, which in turn are set
as your browser’s defaults.</p>
<p>To set up default <code>sans-serif</code>, <code>serif</code> and
<code>monospace</code> fonts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is the Chrome settings link: <a
href="chrome://settings/fonts">chrome://settings/fonts</a>.</li>
<li>For Firefox, go to <a
href="about:preferences#general">about:preferences#general</a> ￫ “Fonts”
￫ “Advanced” to set up fonts for different languages.</li>
<li>For other browsers, please refer to your browser’s
documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the typography… I’ve tried to implement a grid system by using
<code>--var</code> variables, but the result is not satisfactory. The
<code>--var</code>s are substituted with exact values, and I think I’d
redo the grid once I learn more about it. Currently it will stay
as-is.</p>
<p><strong>Comments — Why no comments section?</strong><br />
I haven’t found a satisfactory way to implement comments without adding
hundreds of kilobytes to the load. Currently an average page
<em>plus</em> CSS weighs about 4–5 kilobytes, and I’m not ready to let
the extra bytes seep in, so currently there’s no comment section.
However, I’m looking toward adding it to every post as a separate page,
or maybe implement a guestbook page. So it’s still possible that there
will be one in the future.</p>
<h3 id="disclosures">Disclosures</h3>
<p>These are the things that has possibility of shaping my opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan</strong><br />
I grew up in <strong>Taiwan</strong>, and my world view and common sense
are heavily influenced by this island.</p>
<p><strong>Views on Software</strong><br />
I root for <strong>FOSS software</strong>, even if they are slightly
inferior to their proprietary counterparts; I use the GIMP and Inkscape
for creating graphics, LibreOffice and Pandoc for document preparation,
hardened Firefox as the browser, and Kdenlive for video editing. (The
hardest part is video editing software, as most FOSS solutions of this
regard are either too unstable or too simple. One of the most featureful
FOSS editors, Kdenlive, renders <em>very</em> slow and crashes often for
example.)</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates &amp; Advertising</strong><br />
Currently there is no affiliates and advertising whatsoever. If I did
accept some kind of affiliation I’ll update it here.</p>
<p>(<em>That’s it for now. I’d update the list if necessary</em>)</p>
