<ul>
<li>Better Chinese-English padding</li>

<p>A delve into the depths of Bilingual layouts led me to rewrite the
<code>&lt;span&gt;</code> padding generation code. Now it should look a
lot more graceful than before for Chinese readers.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-1">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Chinese translations of category names</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After this update, the Chinese translations of the categories will
show up beside their English counterparts. I am still thinking how to
make Chinese and English coexist peacefully on the site (as I write in
both), and hopefully this is a first step to a bi-lingual website.</p>
<p>In the future I may add ways to show translations of the same
article, or even separate the site into a Chinese version and English
version. Hard to say what would happen exactly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Added date to all article listings</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve finally added some lines to my update script to grab the last
edited (updated) date and show them beside the article link. Also, the
articles are now sorted based on it, instead of the last modified time
as defined by the computer. Enjoy!</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I finally bought the TLD <a href="https://ltlnx.tw">ltlnx.tw</a>! Now
all content is served over this URL.</p>
<p>Favicons are officially removed. Before this, browsers make favicon
requests to my server, which I don’t have, and complains with error code
404. Courtesy to <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1321878/how-to-prevent-favicon-ico-requests">this
thread on StackOverflow</a>, I added a line to every HTML file to work
around this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:,&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This should prevent 404’s from happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="tldr-6">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix page title generation</li>
<li>Changed sidebar layout on the desktop</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A previous bug in the update code makes every page lack &lt;title&gt;
tags. (No wonder only one page was indexed by Google, and caches are not
refreshed by DuckDuckGo!) This is now fixed, and every page has
titles.</p>
<p>The desktop sidebar has always been an annoyance to me, as it shifts
the content to the right with no benefit in looks or navigation. Now the
sidebar on the desktop is moved up to the top right; I’m still not very
satisfied by the result, but IMO it is a small improvement from the
previous layout. What do you think? Please mail your opinions to the
mailbox in my <a href="about.html#contact-info">Contact info</a>. All
opinions appreciated :)</p>

<h3 id="tldr-7">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every directory has a page</li>
<li>Better subfolder index handling</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I refactored the website update code, so that index page generation
is in a loop: for every folder, generate a page index. Making this part
of the code modular has a side benefit: I don’t need separate code to
generate the homepage anymore.</p>
<p>Another part of code updated is, every index page now shows the first
10 entries in every subfolder, and has a “More” or “Dedicated Page” link
directing to the subfolder index.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="tldr-8">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>The posts now are sorted in chronological order</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t specify the order posts appear on the homepage, so they are
sorted by whatever default <code>find</code> outputs its results. For
some reason I decided to address this issue today, so I searched and
found <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1413494">this answer</a>. I
modified it to output one result per line, so the final code is the
following:</p>
<pre><code>find . -type f &lt;other arguments here&gt; -exec ls -t1 {} +</code></pre>
<p>Currently there’s no dates beside the post list however; I may
address it some day…</p>

<h3 id="tldr-9">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>The update script is updated to use functions more</li>
<li>New footer</li>
<li>The <a href="../blerbs/index.html">blerbs</a> page now has an
<code>index.html</code> for cleaner navigation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The updater script sees an overhaul that makes part of the code more
modular. For example, the “simple subpage layout” generation code is now
a function, so that we can generate multiple subpages with the same
code. This future-proofs possible updates to move tutorials,
documentation, etc. into subfolders.</p>
<p>There’s a new footer to state copyright: Everyone are welcome to copy
stuff from my site or archive them as a whole, but they should release
the content in compliance of the <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons
BY-SA 4.0</a> license. Other terms of copying are on the <a
href="about.html">About</a> page.</p>
<p>Another thing to cover is that subfolder pages now have their own
<code>index.html</code> page, instead of the
<code>all-&lt;subfolder name&gt;.html</code> format. This makes
navigation cleaner, as we only need to key in <a
href="https://ltlnx.codeberg.page/blerbs/"
class="uri">https://ltlnx.codeberg.page/blerbs/</a> instead of <a
href="https://ltlnx.codeberg.page/blerbs/all-blerbs.html"
class="uri">https://ltlnx.codeberg.page/blerbs/all-blerbs.html</a>.</p>

<li>The dark theme is now proudly powered by the <a

palette</a>! Shout out to the great guys at Nord.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The dark theme is now powered by the all-hailed <a
href="https://www.nordtheme.com/">Nord colorscheme</a>! Since the more I
look at the original dark palette, the more it looks like it’s drowned
in molasses (or whisky if you’re in the mood), I went in search for a
cleaner palette. After trying some other color palettes, I found Nord,
highly praised by critics as a serene dark theme with suitable contrast.
I tried it on Vim for a week and loved it, so I thought it’s time to
apply it on the website.</p>
<p>However, I also chose some undocumented colors that Nord uses on
their website, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#242933;letter-spacing:-0.1em">██</span>
<code>#242933</code>, a shade darker than the <span
style="color:#2e3440;letter-spacing:-0.1em">██</span> “nord0” color, for
the background;</li>
<li><span style="color:#abb9cf;letter-spacing:-0.1em">██</span>
<code>#ABB9CF</code>, two shades lighter (I reckon) than the <span
style="color:#4c566a;letter-spacing:-0.1em">██</span> “nord3” color, for
quote text;</li>
<li><span style="color:#638897;letter-spacing:-0.1em">██</span>
<code>#638897</code>, one shade darker than the <span
style="color:#88c0d0;letter-spacing:-0.1em">██</span> “nord8” color, for
quote left borders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this change gives us a cleaner dark theme experience. The <a
href="about.html">about</a> page is updated as well to reflect the
change.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="tldr-12">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>New “source-sans-pro” style rule targetting Android</li>
<li>Subscribe to RSS from the URL bar in supported browsers</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I finally found a way to target Android fonts without it defaulting
to Roboto. Turns out we shouldn’t target the font name like in other
OSes, instead target the generic name defined by
<code>/etc/fonts.xml</code> on Android. Fortunately, there’s a copy of
<code>fonts.xml</code> <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/tags/android-cts-11.0_r8/data/fonts/fonts.xml">available
online</a>, so we can use it as a reference. In the end, I chose
“source-sans-pro” (which is identical to Noto Sans) as the default
display and text font on Android.</p>
<p>Android font support, at this point, still leaves a lot to be
desired. In the “embedded device” mindset of early Android, storage is
scarce and left for other applications, therefore most fonts are only
aliases in a “font definition” file, and there are only a handful of
fonts available on the device.</p>
<p>However currently, where mobile storage easily surpasses desktop
ones, Google (or the Open Handset Alliance, whatever) still didn’t put
better fonts on Android devices, and only added Noto fonts for language
support. Come on, it’s 2022! Why cripple a key point in good UI for
reasons that isn’t a concern anymore?</p>
<p>Another change is the ability to subscribe to the site by simply
clicking the RSS button in the URL bar. It once was a Firefox feature,
but Firefox <a
href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/feed-reader-replacements-firefox">phased
it out</a> in favor of their “Pocket” service. What a shame! Luckily,
the feature lives on in some Firefox derivatives like Pale Moon.</p>
<p>IE also supported RSS subscriptions, but sadly the browser’s obsolete
at this point. Chrome didn’t support such stuff from the beginning, but
the functionality can be added with an <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd">official
Google extension</a>.</p>
<p>To make the RSS icon show, I added an RSS feed link to every
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;All Pages on the Website&quot; href=&quot;https://ltlnx.codeberg.page/rssfeed.xml&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then, <em>ta-da</em>! The rss icon shows in the address bar:</p>
<figure>
<img src="res/rss-feed-icon-palemoon.png"
alt="RSS icon in the address bar" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">RSS icon in the address bar</figcaption>

<p>There’s a new <a

website! Generated by a <a
href="https://codeberg.org/ltlnx/pages-src/src/branch/main/sitemap">bash
script</a> based on <a
href="https://github.com/mcmilk/sitemap-generator">mcmilk’s script</a>,
hopefully it would bring a bit of SEO benefit to this blog. Also, I
implemented a RSS feed, generated by a <a
href="https://codeberg.org/ltlnx/pages-src/src/branch/main/rss-roller">heavily
modified version</a> of maxhebditch’s <a
href="https://codeberg.org/ltlnx/pages/commits/branch/main">rss-roller</a>
. Both are bash scripts, which is easier for me to modify and
maintain.</p>
<p>Originally there are no <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> attributes in all
my webpages, since I used a shared header template to generate them.
Today I added some <code>sed</code> trickery to extract titles from
original markdown files, and add them as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
elements. This should also have a positive effect in SEO.</p>

<ul>
<li>New dark theme for <code>@media(prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>
guys
<ul>
<li>Inspired by the vim colorscheme “Slate”</li>
<li>But with less colors</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>sed</code> expression to convert arrows to better-looking
arrows</li>
<li>Added hover highlights</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So I eventually put out a dark theme, and minified the css a bit. Not
in the sense of emitting all newlines, as I absolutely <em>despise</em>
that; more like sharing some style blocks and removing newlines for
elements with only one style.</p>
<p>The dark theme is inspired by vim’s “Slate” theme, which is the only
theme in vim with a softer color palette; others are razor-sharp and
often an eyesore. However, the colorscheme features a lot of colors, and
when I tried them on different elements, I found out that I can’t
harmonize them perfectly. So I retreated to one main color, and other
auxillary colors referring to it.</p>
<p>Currently, the text color of the dark theme is kind of a washed-out
orange, malt-like color. I’m thinking whether to make it plain white —
just like how the original Slate theme treats text. I think I’m going to
keep it until people complain.</p>
<p>The website generation script also had a small change: due to my
abuse of code-style arrows (-&gt;), I infused a sed expression to
convert it to an arrow (￫). However, currently it converts code
representations to arrows too, but I haven’t found an easy fix to
it.</p>
<p>I might as well type a proper arrow with the help of the
<em>compose</em> key (which is as easy as
<code>Compose + hyphen + greater-than</code>), but in Noto Sans, the
default arrow looks like this:</p>
<p>←↑↓→</p>
<p>Which, for some reason, looks bad in desktop Firefox. So I decided to
use Unicode codepoints FFE9 to FFEC (￩￪￬￫), which has a more consistent
look across devices.</p>
<p>Another change is that links now have non-intrustive hover
highlights, which used some CSS trickery to make the highlighted link
stay in place. The technique is copied from <a
href="https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/fixed-width-highlight-on-hover/">a
reply on CSS Tricks website</a>. The answer was missing a
<code>margin-right</code> but that’s an easy fix.</p>
