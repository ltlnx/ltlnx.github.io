<h3 id="html-and-web-standards">HTML and Web standards</h3>
<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">The HTML Standard</a><br />
The official specsheet of HTML. For creating HTML rendering tools or
better semantic HTML. Do note that this is a <em>“Living Standard”</em>,
which means that it may be changed any time. (Not a fan of this but
well…)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/">W3 Requirements for Chinese
Text Layout</a><br />
A good reference for typesetting Chinese text on the Web and other
places. Includes basics on typefaces, page design, writing modes, line
composition (where to break lines), punctuation marks, etc. Though not
all of the requirements have been regulated in the HTML spec, it gives
us a high-level understanding of how Chinese text <em>should</em> look
like on the Web.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">W3 Requirements for Japanese
Text Layout</a><br />
A similar document to the above, but for Japanese text. Japanese shares
a lot of characteristics with Chinese, therefore this also serves as a
resource for typesetting Chinese. Plus, this is commisioned far earlier
than the Chinese version and is therefore more stable and has more
implemented standards.</p>

Tests which cipher suites a web server has.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a><br />
Test various metrics of websites, like load speed, contentful paints,
etc., and offers waterfall views of loads. Useful to test websites in
various locations and settings.</p>

<h3 id="linux-and-system-management">Linux and System Management</h3>
<p><a href="https://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a><br />
DistroWatch is a website dedicated to Linux, BSD and OpenSolaris
distributions, featuring distro introduction pages, bundled software
version overviews, comments on distros, distro popularity rankings, and
more. On the homepage, they also have distro update briefings and one of
my favorite reads on the web, DistroWatch Weekly. If you’re a Linux
enthusiast and distro-hopper like me, you would probably love this
site.</p>
<p><a href="https://linux.vbird.org/">鳥哥的<span
lang="en">Linux</span>私房菜</a> (zh-TW)<br />
An inclusive resource for learning Linux and system administration in
general. Covers mostly RHEL-based OSes (RHEL, CentOS, Rocky/Alma) and
discusses a broad range of Linux-related topics in detail. Definitely a
great place to go if you speak/read Chinese and are interested in
sharpening your Linux skills.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Linux/index.html">PTT 看板<span
lang="en"> Linux</span></a> (zh-TW)<br />
Discussion on Linux in general, in Traditional Chinese. Requires a PTT
account.</p>

<h3 id="bash-and-shell-scripting-in-general">Bash and Shell Scripting in
General</h3>
<p><a href="https://subsignal.org/doc/AliensBashTutorial.html">Alien’s
Bash Tutorial</a><br />
An exceptionally good tutorial on UNIX/Linux structure, common commands,
bash and bash scripting.</p>
<p><a href="https://edoras.sdsu.edu/doc/sed-oneliners.html">Handy
one-liners for SED</a><br />
More that often we need to mangle with text, and one of the more
powerful tools to do that is <code>sed</code>. This page contains some
useful knowledge when approaching it, as well as a large number of
one-liners ready to apply into your scripts.</p>

<h3 id="news-and-aggregation-sites">News and Aggregation Sites</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a><br />
A news aggregation site based on user submissions, with an upvote system
to ensure quality. There is a comments page for every submission, and in
the comments, often there are high-quality discussions from people who
know the subject well. As the name suggests, submissions usually
surround tech, engineering and things that interest these kinds of
people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com">The Register</a><br />
A technology news site from the UK. Reports on systems administration,
Linux distributions, tech regulation changes, software, coding tools and
languages, etc. What I like a lot is their tech columns, which features
sysadmins who fucked up databases, cringey management or bosses, tech
support woes, and the like — and besides being entertaining, it gives us
a glimpse into the real-life tech world.</p>
